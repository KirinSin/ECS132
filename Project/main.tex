\section{Problem A}
\label{PA}
We use users' average ratings as random samples to compute the approximate 95\% confidence
interval for: the population mean rating by men, by women, and the difference between the two means. We show the results in Table~\ref{tab1}.
\begin{table*}[ht]
\begin{tabular}{l*{2}{c}r}
                 & From & To \\
\hline
approx. CI for E(ratings by men) & 3.561174 & 3.616033 \\
approx. CI for E(ratings by women) & 3.556519 & 3.617838  \\
approx. CI for E(rating diffs by gender) & -0.03971356 & 0.04256391\\
\end{tabular}
\caption{Approximate 95\% confidence interval for various means.}
\label{tab1}
\end{table*}

From Table~\ref{tab1} we observe that the center of approximate 95\% confidence interval of the rating differences by gender is close to 0. Let the null hypothesis be that "the male and female population means are equal". We form a significance test of this hypothesis. We show the output of our significant test in the following code snapshot:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
Two Sample t-test

data: a and b
t = 0.0446, df = 941, p-value = 0.9645
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 -0.06134628  0.06419663
sample estimates:
mean of x mean of y 
 3.588604  3.587179
\end{lstlisting}
The 0.9645 p-value shows no significant evidence to reject the null hypothesis, thus we should accept the hypothesis that the male and female population means are equal. Figure~\ref{fig1} further corroborates our conclusion.
\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{ratings.pdf}

\label{fig1}
\end{figure}

We show the approximate 95\% confidence interval for the difference between the population mean number of ratings by men and women, as well as the approximate 95\% confidence interval for the population proportion of users who are men in Table~\ref{tab2}
\begin{table*}[h]
\begin{tabular}{l*{2}{c}r}
                 & From & To \\

\end{tabular}
\caption{Approximate 95\% confidence interval for mean diff and proportion.}

We use a linear model to estimate the population regression function in which we predict rating from age and gender. The summary output is shown in the following code snapshot:

\end{lstlisting}
The confidence interval of $\beta_1$ (age coefficient) is from 0.001064581 to 0.01714. From the output of $summary(lmout)$ we observe that its p-value is 0.00436, which means the difference between null hypothesis ($\beta_1$ is 0) and our sample results is significant enough for us to reject the null hypothesis.

The approximate 95\% confidence interval for population mean rating of women of age 28 is from 3.513127 to 3.621827. We show the visualization of our linear model in Figure~\ref{fig2}.

\section{Problem B}
\label{PB}
In this section we analyze the Wordbank dataset. More specifically, we form a linear regression model from a description point of view, by showing the relationship between vocabulary size and age (in months), birth order, ethnicity, sex and mon's education. Figure~\ref{fig:sfig1} shows the quantile of vocabulary size at different age. We observe a clear direct proportional relationship between age and vocabulary size. We also observe such relationship in Figure~\ref{fig:sfig2}, which shows the linear regression model of vocabulary size with age. It also reveals that female children have larger mean vocabulary size than male children, at all ages, regardless of other factors.

\end{figure}

\begin{tabular}{l*{1}{c}r}
Category & Sample Size \\
\hline

\hline
Race & Asian: 71 Hispanic: 133 Black: 231 White: 2228 Other: 100  \\

\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Sample size in terms of gender and race.}
\label{tab1}
\end{table*}

To find the more detailed relationship, we perform the linear regression prediction for vocabulary size using all the variables, including age, gender, ethnicity, birth order, and mother's education level. In our first linear model, we convert all the categorical variables (gender, ethnicity, birth order, and mother's education level) into dummy variables, and use R's lm function to achieve our model. By making all the variables dummy variables, we can obtain the first model with Multiple R-squared value being 0.5151. From the model, age and gender has the lowest P values which are less than 2e-16. Small P value shows that it is more likely to fit the data. Each unit increase in age (one month) will cause 33.3164 increase in the mean value of vocabulary size. In general, male children will have a 48.6006 decrease of mean value of vocabulary size. Followed by age and gender, comes the factor of being white, or having a mother with secondary education, or college education. However, the P value for those variables are significantly larger which are around 0.0005. Thus the results shows that both birth order and graduate education level has no impact on the vocabulary size.

In order to improve the model, only age and gender were used as predictors. As the model turns out, it has a Multiple R-squared value being 0.6095 which shows that the model is better than the previous one with a Multiple R-squared value being 0.515. However, with the sample size being 5498, a maximum size of 74 predictor variables can be used, so more tests were done to see if a better model can be obtained.

A further analysis of linear model of vocabulary size using age and gender, only race, only education level, and only birth order, further proves that birth order has no impact on the vocabulary size. Specifically, the race factor, as shown in the third model with a multiple R-squared being 0.005969 which is very small. As a result, the race factor is not selected as a predictor. On the other hand, we observe the factor of being white, which has a small p value being 0.0086, and discover that the sample population is over 2000. As the sample size grows, any data can become significant, so a small p-value does not make being white or not a good predictor. Then with a model formed around the order of the child's birth, a multiple R-squared value of 0.01739 is obtained which is still rather small. For education level, it has even smaller adjusted R-squared value than birth order (0.004584 vs. 0.01488). Moreover, every single factor in this model has a P-value over 0.1 which showed that this model is not a good fit either. The linear model with all the above factors excluded and uses only age and gender achieves a highest adjusted R-squared value of 0.6093.

Based on the above reasoning, we finalize our linear model with only gender and age. The linear model is presented as follows:
\begin{align*}
\bar{V} &= b_0 + b_1 Age + b_2 IsMale \\
b_0 &= -484.1307 \\
b_1 &= 34.8168 \\
b_2 &= -39.6868 \\
IsMale &= \{1,0\} \\
\end{align*}

We conclude that age (in month) significantly predicted positive vocabulary size, $b_1=34.8168$, $t(4096)=79.239$, $p<2e-16$; gender (whether the child is male or not) significantly predicted negative vocabulary size, $b_2=-39.6868$, $t(4096)=-9.208$, $p<2e-16$. Together age and gender explained a large portion of variance in vocabulary sizes, $R^2=.6093, F(2,4096)=3176, p<2.2e-16$. One month of age growth will contribute to 34.8168 increase of vocabulary size, being a male child will contribute to 39.6868 decrease of vocabulary size.
