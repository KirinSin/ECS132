<h2>Problem 1</h2>

<p>
This continues Problem 1 in Homework I.
</p>

<p> <OL type = "a">

<li> Find the expected value of the weight of the
first item placed into Box 2.
</li> </p>

<li> Find the variance of that weight.
</li> </p>

<li> Write simulation code to verify your answers above.
Place your code in a file <b> Hwk2.1.R</b>,
with functions named <b>parta()</b> and <b>partb()</b>.
They should have a single argument, <b>nreps</b>. 

</OL> </p>

<h2>Problem 2</h2>

<p>
This problem concerns the bus ridership example in our book.
</p>

<p> <OL type = "a">

<li> Find Cov(L<sub>1</sub>,L<sub>2</sub>).
</li> </p>

<li> Verify the above by simulation.
Place your code in a file <b> Hwk2.2.R</b>, with function <b>parta()</b>.
</li> </p>

</OL> </p>

<h2>Problem 3</h2>

<p>
Let X and Y be indicator random variables such that P(X = 1), P(Y = 1)
and P(X = Y = 1) are p, q and r, respectively.  Find Var(X+Y), as a
function of p, q and r.
</p>

<p>
<b>EXTRA CREDIT QUESTION:</b> Write simulation code, with arguments <b>p</b>,
<b>q</b>, <b>r</b> and <b>nreps</b> to verify your result above. The
challenge is to write code that will generate (X,Y) pairs with the given
probabilities.  Place your code in <b>Hwk2.Bonus.R</b>, in the function
<b>parta()</b>.
</p>

<h2>Problem 4</h2>

<p>
This problem concerns the Preferential Attachment Graph Model in our
text.  Define D<sub>j</sub> to be the degree of node N<sub>j</sub>, 
<i>before</i> v<sub>j</sub> is added, j = 3,4,5,...
</p>

<p> <OL type = "a">

<li> Find ED<sub>4</sub>.
</li> </p>

<li> Write simulation code to verify your above answer, placing your
code in <b>Hwk2.4.R</b>, function <b>parta()</b>.

</OL> </p>
